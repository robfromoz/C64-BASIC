# C64-BASIC
Commodore BASIC programs that I have written over the years.

I have provided these programs in both an ASCII format, so you can examine the code (if you really want to!) and a PRG format so that you can run them on your favourite emulator.

I have deliberately designed these programs so that they can be ported with little effort onto systems such as Apple II, TRS-80, BBC Micro, and other systems that have BASIC interpreters.

You may use these programs and modify them as you wish, provided that you give me credit. These might be silly programs but I did take the effort and the time to write them, so some acknowledgment wouldn't go astray.

Enjoy. :)
